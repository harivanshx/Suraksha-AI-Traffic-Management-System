# Dataset Setup

Since you have your own dataset, please organize it in the standard YOLO structure inside the `data` folder or anywhere you prefer, but update the config paths accordingly.

Standard YOLO structure:

```
data/
  train/
    images/
    labels/
  val/
    images/
    labels/
```

If you already have a trained model (e.g., `best.pt`), place it in the `models/` directory.
