    <h1>Smart Road Safety & Traffic Control System</h1>
    <p>
        Hey, we're a team of engineers tired of seeing lives lost on Indian roads every day. 
        Our AI-powered system is built to detect accidents fast, manage traffic smarter, 
        and get help to people quicker. so fewer families have to go through the worst.

    <h2>🚨 Why This Keeps Happening</h2>
    <p>
        In 2024 alone, around 1.77 lakh people lost their lives in road accidents in India—that's over 480 deaths every single day. 
        Many of these tragedies aren't just because of the crash itself, but because help doesn't arrive in time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "golden hour" is real: if emergency services can reach victims quickly, a huge number of deaths (some studies say up to 30-50%) can be prevented. 
        But right now, delays in reporting, no exact location sharing, jammed roads, and slow response mean too many people don't make it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've seen the stats, read the stories, and honestly—it hits hard. We wanted to do something about it.
    </p>

<section id="solution">
    <h2>💡 Our Take on Fixing This</h2>
    <p>
        We're working on a practical, AI-driven system that spots accidents the moment they happen, 
        handles traffic intelligently, and alerts the right people instantly with exact location and details.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can run as a mobile app for riders/drivers, get built into smart helmets, or connect to city CCTV cameras. 
        Using computer vision, sensors, GPS, and quick decision-making, it detects crashes, fires, violations—and gets help moving fast.
    </p>
    <p>
        No more waiting around wondering if anyone knows. Just faster action to save lives.

    <div class="card-container">

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Accident Detection</h3>
            <p>
                Uses cameras + sensors to spot crashes in real-time (even minor ones or bike falls). 
                Sends instant alert with GPS location, photos, and time so help arrives quicker.

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Smart Traffic Density Control</h3>
            <p>
                Watches vehicle flow with AI, adjusts signals on the fly to cut congestion—no more endless red lights when roads are empty.

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Emergency Vehicle Priority</h3>
            <p>
                Spots ambulances, fire trucks, police—automatically turns lights green for them and holds others so they reach faster.

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Traffic Rule Violation Detection</h3>
            <p>
                Catches no-helmet riding, signal jumping, wrong-way driving using live video analysis. Helps enforce rules without constant manual checks.

            <h3>Smart Helmet Integration</h3>
            <p>
                For two-wheeler riders—sensors in the helmet detect hard falls or crashes, auto-alert family + emergency if the rider is unresponsive.
